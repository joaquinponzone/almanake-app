# Almanake App

Almanake App is a modern calendar application built with Next.js, React, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS. It features interactive calendar views, event management, and customizable themes.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies with Bun:

```bash
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
